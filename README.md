## How I set up

- My terminal: ghostty
- My shell: zsh
- My tool: lazydocker, lazygit, fzf, gh, starship, lazy-vim, tmux, etc.

## How to use

Clone this repository and use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink the configuration files to your home directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/garovu/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
stow -t ~ <package>
```

Replace `<package>` with the folder name you want to stow (e.g., `zsh`, `nvim`, `tmux`). This will create symlinks in your home directory for the selected configuration.
